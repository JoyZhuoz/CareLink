>>> What is John Smith's current recovery status and what questions should I ask on the next check-in call?

=== Response ===

Based on John Smith's records, here's his current recovery status and recommended check-in approach:

## Current Recovery Status (Post-Op Day 3)

**Overall:** Stable and progressing as expected for ACL reconstruction

**Key Findings:**
- Pain is moderate (6/10 standing, 3/10 at rest) - within normal range
- Mild swelling present but being managed with ice/elevation
- Incision appears clean with no drainage or signs of infection
- No fever, chills, or concerning symptoms
- Patient is compliant with medications and ankle pumps
- Using brace appropriately

**Risk Considerations:**
- Diabetes + obesity increase infection and DVT risk
- Requires close monitoring of wound healing
- Enhanced focus on mobility/circulation exercises

## Recommended Check-in Questions for Next Call

Given his risk factors and current status, prioritize these questions:

1. **Pain Assessment:** "How is your pain today on a scale of 1 to 10, both at rest and when you're moving around?"

2. **Wound/Infection Monitoring:** "Can you describe how your incision looks today? Any redness, warmth, drainage, or changes since yesterday?"

3. **DVT Screening:** "Have you noticed any pain, swelling, or warmth in your calf or lower leg? How often are you doing your ankle pumps?"

4. **Mobility Progress:** "Have you been able to take short walks as instructed? How is your knee bending coming along?"

5. **Systemic Symptoms:** "Any fever, chills, or feeling unwell overall?"

**Focus Areas:** Given his diabetes and obesity, spend extra time on wound appearance and DVT symptoms. Reinforce the importance of daily skin checks and maintaining movement within prescribed limits.
